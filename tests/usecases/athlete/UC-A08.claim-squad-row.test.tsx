 * Scope note. This use case's first two clauses — "the squad row is linked to
 * their account" and "the coach and athlete are genuinely connected in the
 * database" — are assertions about what link_player_to_coach does server-side,
 * and cannot honestly be proven against a mocked PostgREST. Mocking the RPC to
 * return success and calling that "genuinely connected" would assert the thing
 * it is meant to check.
 *
 * What is provable here, and is covered below: the screen exists at all, it
 * sends the code the athlete typed, and it tells them the truth about the
 * outcome. The database half belongs to the U2 run against the live project.
