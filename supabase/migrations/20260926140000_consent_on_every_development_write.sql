-- G1 (MVP Requirements): no development record about an under-18 exists
-- without active consent, on every write path. G6: withdrawal stops
-- processing at once.
--
-- Before this migration only two writes checked consent: a new assessment and
-- a new award. After a guardian withdrew, a coach could still edit an
-- assessment, write or edit its private note, publish or edit the message,
-- take attendance, and log a match through log_match_for_player. A child could
-- also write match rows about themselves, although player logging is cut.
--
-- recognition_awards is not handled here: awards are parked (TRAK-47, #134
-- 20260924000002), so app roles can't write them at all.
--
-- Each policy below is recreated with its existing clauses plus the consent
-- predicate, through the RLS bridge trak_private.squad_player_consent_required
-- (20260921182442). Consent is enforced by policies, so account deletion and
-- coach departure, which run as SECURITY DEFINER maintenance, can still update
-- these rows for a child whose guardian has withdrawn. One invoker trigger per
-- table stops an app client moving a record to another child (see the end);
-- maintenance passes it the same way.
--
-- The coach can still retract a published message after withdrawal (G6,
-- 20260921110000), and only retract: the text, assessment and owner stay as
-- they were.
--
-- Unknown age fails closed (MVP J1: a missing date of birth counts as a
-- minor). 20260912000001 let writes through for a roster row with no account
-- and for a player with no date of birth. Neither can hold consent
-- (record_parental_consent refuses a missing DOB), so both now wait.
