-- The stale-consent report must see children whose parent was never invited
--
-- 20260912000001's stale_pending_consent view filters on
--   COALESCE(pi.created_at, now()) < now() - interval '30 days'
-- For an under-age player with no parent_invites row at all, that collapses
-- to now() < now() - 30 days, which is never true. The report is blind to
-- the worst case it exists to catch: a child who needs consent and has no
-- parent anywhere in the loop. Verified against the live project on
-- 2026-09-19: one such child exists and the view returns zero rows for them.
--
-- Secondary defect: the LEFT JOIN is unaggregated, so a child with several
-- invites appears once per invite.
--
-- What this does:
--   * Invited but unanswered: 30 days from the most recent invite. A parent
--     was asked; day three is noise, a month is a nudge.
--   * Never invited: reported immediately. Onboarding requires a parent
--     email when consent is needed and create_parent_invite() runs inside
--     provision_my_profile(), so a missing invite row means provisioning
--     partially failed. That is a defect signal, not a staleness signal, and
--     a month of a child who cannot be assessed and cannot find out why is
--     the wrong response to it.
--   * Joins the latest invite only, so the report has one row per child.
--   * Same columns in the same order, so CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW applies and
--     every existing grant is preserved. invited_at and waiting_for are NULL
--     for the never-invited case; that null is the finding.
--
-- 20260918070209 set security_invoker and restricted this view to
-- service_role SELECT. Both survive CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW; both are
-- re-applied below regardless, so this file does not depend on that.
