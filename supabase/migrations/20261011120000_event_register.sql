-- TRAK-138 (J8.15): after the event, the coach's register becomes the
-- completed session that assessments already require (TRAK-68), without
-- re-entering the date, squad or players.
--
-- A session remembers the event it came from (coach_sessions.event_id), one
-- session per event, so saving the register twice never makes a second one.
-- take_event_register() runs as the coach (SECURITY INVOKER): the J4 write
-- path's own policies apply unchanged, so it can only write the coach's
-- sessions, attendance for their current squad, and never attendance for a
-- child whose consent isn't active (G1). It checks consent first only to say
-- so in words. Attendance becomes exactly the list sent: present rows only,
-- as the J4 screens write; a player left off is absent. The database still
-- refuses to remove an assessed player's attendance (TRAK-100).
--
-- Only a published event that went ahead and has started (TRAK-67: never a
-- future session). A match goes through the match log, which records the
-- score, minutes and goals.
