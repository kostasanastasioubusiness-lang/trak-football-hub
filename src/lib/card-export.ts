 * `PlayerEvolutionCard` called `navigator.share({ title, text })` with no
 * `files` key at all, so the OS share sheet had nothing but a string to hand to
 * Messages and the player got their stats as plain text.
 *
 * The capture is genuinely fiddly — fonts have to be loaded, a fit-to-viewport
 * transform has to come off first, scroll position has to be compensated — so
 * it lives here once rather than being copied into the second screen. Copying
 * it is what produced four band ladders.

 * `display: block`, so the probe drops onto its own line and the "baseline"
 * becomes a whole line height. Every glyph is then drawn too low, by an amount
 * that grows with font size: the exported cards had names sliced through by
 * overflow:hidden and "74" printed over "MIDFIELDER" while the screen was fine.
 *
 * The rule matches only that probe, by the fixed src html2canvas 1.4.1 gives it,
 * and exists only for the duration of a capture. A test pins the src against
