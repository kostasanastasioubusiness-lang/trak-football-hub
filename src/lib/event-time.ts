 * connection's timezone, which for PostgREST is UTC, so a coach in Dubai
 * entering 18:00 stored 18:00Z, four hours later than they meant.
 *
 * It looked fine to the coach only because the schedule read the value back by
 * slicing characters out of the raw ISO string, recovering the same UTC wall
 * clock it had sent. The player screen did the honest thing — `new Date(...)`
 * then render in the device's zone — and so showed 22:00 for a 6pm session.
 * Two bugs that cancelled on one screen and not on the other.
 *

 * interpreted in that person's own timezone, in both directions.
