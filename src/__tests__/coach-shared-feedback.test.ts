/**
 * K9's product half: the coach can write feedback for the child and publish it
 * deliberately.
 *
 * Without this, K9 is a net removal — the four children who can currently read
 * a coach note read nothing, and no coach can give them anything, because the
 * table has no writer. The pilot's fourth pillar is "the loop must close:
 * coach assesses -> athlete sees", so shipping the privacy fix alone breaks the
 * thing we demo.
 *
 * "No auto-copy" is a schema property in the migration. These assert it is also
 * a UI property, which is where it would actually be violated: one careless
 * `setShared(note)` and every private note becomes publishable in one tap.
