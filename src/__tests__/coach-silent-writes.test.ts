/**
 * One defect class, six instances, three files, all found in a single day:
 *
 *   K5              three writes in CoachAddSession discarded their error, then
 *                   said "Match saved" and navigated away
 *   Imad on #44     three more in CoachAssessPage — a failed publish that
 *                   navigated home, and a save that saved nothing and reported
 *                   success through .maybeSingle() returning null with no error
 *   this sweep      CoachHomePage treated a FAILED READ as "no invite code" and
 *                   overwrote the coach's existing one
 *
 * The shape is always the same: **absence of an error taken as evidence of
 * success.** CLAUDE.md states the rule — "Always inspect query errors; a failed
 * request is not an empty result" — and it kept being broken anyway.
 *
 * So this asserts the rule over every routed coach surface rather than pinning
 * the six lines that happened to be wrong, because the next instance will be a
 * seventh line nobody remembers to add here.
