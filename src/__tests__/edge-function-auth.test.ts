/**
 * Guards K8 (X4).
 *
 * `parse-schedule` had no authentication of any kind — no getUser, no 401 —
 * with `verify_jwt = false`, so any unauthenticated request on the internet
 * could spend LOVABLE_API_KEY on the Lovable gateway, image input included.
 * `coach-assistant` called getUser() but only to personalise the prompt: no
 * user meant an empty context block and the request proceeded anyway.
 *
 * The reason both survived is worth encoding rather than just fixing:
 * `supabase/config.toml` described coach-assistant as "calls getUser() itself
 * and 401s without a valid user". It did not. A comment asserting a safety
 * property the code does not have is the actual defect — the same shape as the
 * false claim in 20260917000002 that Imad's F4 caught.
 *
 * Static checks over the function sources. They cannot prove the deployed
 * functions reject; they fail if a function that spends the AI key stops
 * checking who is calling.
