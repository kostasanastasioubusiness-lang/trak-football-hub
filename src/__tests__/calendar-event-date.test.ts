/**
 * Guards 20260918000001, which gives coach_calendar_events a real calendar
 * date and a way to say the time is not known.
 *
 * The table stored only `starts_at timestamptz`, so "time to be confirmed"
 * was encoded as local midnight — indistinguishable from a genuine midnight
 * event, and a value that moves to the previous day when read in a
 * different timezone. An untimed event entered as 1 March in Dubai read as
 * 28 February 20:00 in Athens.
 *
 * These are static checks over the migration files. They cannot prove the
 * live table is correct; they fail if someone removes the columns, or
 * reintroduces the two mistakes that are easy to make here.
