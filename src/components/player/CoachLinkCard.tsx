/**
 * Lets a player connect to a coach AFTER signup.
 *
 * The coach code field used to exist in exactly one place — step 3 of
 * onboarding — and nowhere else. A player who tapped past it (or signed up
 * before their coach had handed the code out, which is the normal order in a
 * pilot) had no way to link, ever: no UI on the profile, none in Settings, and
 * Settings actively told them to "share your invite code", which players do not
 * have. The only remedy was deleting the account and starting again.
 *
 * The server side already existed — link_player_to_coach has been in the
 * migrations since 20260611000001 and was improved again in 20260901000006 to
 * claim the coach's existing roster row rather than duplicate it.
