  speed: {
    title: 'Developing your pace and acceleration',
    what: "Your coach wants to see you sharper off the mark — those first 5 metres make the difference between winning the ball and losing it.",
    why: "Explosive acceleration in short bursts creates chances and wins duels. It's not about top speed — it's about reacting and moving before defenders can set.",
    drill: "Set up 4 cones in a line, 5m apart. From a standing start, sprint through all 4, walk back, repeat. Focus entirely on your first 2 steps — drive your knees up and push hard off the ground. 8 reps, 3 sets. Do this twice a week and you'll notice real improvement within a month.",
  },
  dribbling: {
    title: 'Taking players on in 1v1 situations',
    what: "Your coach wants you to commit to taking players on more — using your body, change of pace, and ball control to beat defenders confidently.",
    why: "A player who can regularly beat their man in a 1v1 creates overloads and opens up space for the whole team. It's one of the most direct ways to change a game.",
    drill: "Set up a cone 10m away. Dribble toward it at pace, use a sharp move to go around it (inside cut, stepover, chop, drag-back — rotate between them), then accelerate away. Do 10 reps of each move, focusing on keeping the ball under tight control at speed, not just nudging it past.",
  },
  heading: {
    title: 'Winning aerial duels',
    what: "Your coach has flagged your heading — specifically the timing of your jump and making clean contact with the right part of the ball.",
    why: "Set pieces and long balls decide a huge number of youth football matches. A player who is confident in the air becomes an asset at both attacking corners and defending them.",
    drill: "Start by throwing a ball slightly above your head and heading it back — focus on using your forehead (not the top of your head) and snapping your neck through the ball. Progress to jumping headers from standing. Get a teammate to deliver from the side so you practice timing your run. 20 reps every session.",
  },
  passing: {
    title: 'Sharpening your passing and tempo',
    what: "Your coach wants tighter passing — either the weight, the decision-making, or the speed of release needs to improve so your team keeps moving forward.",
    why: "Accurate, well-timed passing keeps your team in control and in rhythm. A player who can deliver the right pass at the right moment is impossible to press effectively.",
    drill: "Rondo 4v1: 4 players keep the ball from 1 defender in a small square. Maximum 2 touches. Add a rule that one pass per round must switch to the opposite side of the square. This trains quick release and disguising your intent under pressure.",
  },
  first_touch: {
    title: 'Improving your first touch under pressure',
    what: "When defenders close you down, your first touch is taking the ball away from your next move — giving them the chance to win it back.",
    why: "A clean first touch into space gives you a split-second that changes the whole situation. Controlling the ball before defenders fully arrive is one of the highest-value technical skills you can develop.",
    drill: "Ask a teammate to throw the ball at you from 5m away while you face away. On the throw, turn and direct your first touch into space with one movement. Repeat 20 times to each side. The goal is placing the touch exactly where you want — not just stopping the ball.",
  },
  positioning: {
    title: 'Reading the game and finding space',
    what: "Your coach wants to see smarter movement — particularly where you are when your team is out of possession and how you position yourself to receive.",
    why: "Good positioning makes every other skill more effective. Players who are in the right place at the right time always look like they have more time on the ball — because they've already done the thinking.",
    drill: "In your next training session, spend the first 15 minutes focusing only on positioning — not worrying about the ball at all. Every 10 seconds ask yourself: 'Am I in the best position right now? Where does space open up if we win the ball here?' Develop the habit of constant repositioning.",
  },
  shooting: {
    title: 'Improving your finishing',
    what: "Your coach wants you to be more clinical — hitting the target more consistently and choosing the right technique for each opportunity.",
    why: "Finishing is the most direct way to impact the result. Better technique and decision-making in front of goal can translate to extra goals across a season.",
    drill: "Place 5 balls at the edge of the box. Practice finishing with different techniques in sequence: laces-driven shot, inside-foot placed finish, first-time hit, and a 1-2 fake before shooting. For every shot, pick a specific corner before you strike — placement over power every time.",
  },
  work_rate: {
    title: 'Pressing intensity and effort off the ball',
    what: "Your coach wants to see more energy when your team doesn't have the ball — pressing higher and closing space more quickly to force mistakes.",
    why: "Teams that press well win the ball in dangerous areas and make life hard for opponents. Individual pressing effort — even when it doesn't result in a steal — creates pressure that lifts the whole team.",
    drill: "Pick a press trigger: when the ball goes to feet, when it's played backwards, or when the keeper has it. Every time that trigger happens, sprint to close within 2 seconds. In training, set yourself a target of 10 correct press moments per session and track them mentally.",
  },
  tracking: {
    title: 'Tracking runners defensively',
    what: "When opposition players make runs in behind, you're staying too high — your coach has noticed gaps appearing that defenders are being left to deal with alone.",
    why: "Tracking runners is one of the most valuable defensive habits in the game. It stops goals, keeps your team's shape intact, and protects your defenders in situations they shouldn't face.",
    drill: "In your next team training, pick one opposition player to track for the whole session — wherever they run, you follow. Communicate with centre-backs: 'I've got him' or 'yours.' Build the habit of glancing behind you every few seconds. Awareness first, then the reaction.",
  },
  awareness: {
    title: 'Scanning before you receive the ball',
    what: "You need to check your shoulders more before the ball arrives so you already know your options when it reaches you — instead of deciding under pressure.",
    why: "Players who scan before receiving look a step ahead of everyone else on the pitch. It's what makes some players seem like they always have time — they've processed the picture before touching the ball.",
    drill: "Every time you're about to receive in training, count how many shoulder checks you do before the ball arrives. Aim for at least 2. Do this in warm-ups and rondos as well as full games — it needs to become completely automatic.",
  },
  communication: {
    title: 'Being vocal and organising around you',
    what: "Your coach wants you to be more communicative — directing teammates, calling for the ball, and making sure the players around you know what's happening.",
    why: "Communicating players make the whole team better by reducing confusion and increasing structure. Coaches at every level look for players who can lead through their voice as well as their ability.",
    drill: "Set yourself a target in every session: say at least 20 things out loud. 'Man on!', 'Turn!', 'Mine!', 'Switch it!', 'Time!'. It'll feel forced at first — do it anyway. Within a few sessions your teammates will start relying on your voice and it'll become second nature.",
  },
  crossing: {
    title: 'Delivery and crossing from wide areas',
    what: "Your coach wants your delivery from wide positions to be more consistent — the right weight and flight to reach your forwards at pace.",
    why: "Quality crossing directly creates goals. Even a 10% improvement in delivery accuracy translates to more chances created per game.",
    drill: "Set up targets in the box — a cone at the near post, one at the penalty spot, one at the far post. Deliver 10 crosses to each target from both sides. Focus on your approach angle: a curved run into the ball gives you more power and whip than running straight.",
  },
  confidence: {
    title: 'Backing yourself on the ball',
    what: "Your coach has noticed moments where you're second-guessing yourself — taking the safe option or giving it back too quickly when pressed.",
    why: "Confidence on the ball is a skill you build, not just a feeling you wait for. The more decisions you commit to in training — right or wrong — the more natural everything becomes in a match.",
    drill: "In training, give yourself permission to make mistakes. Pick 3 things to attempt in the next session (a specific dribble, a long switch, a turn under pressure) and try each at least 3 times. The goal is the attempt, not the outcome. Confidence comes from reps, not from getting it right every time.",
  },
  fitness: {
    title: 'Physical platform and athleticism',
    what: "Your coach wants to see more physicality — whether that's in duels, second-half intensity, or your ability to recover and get into position quickly.",
    why: "Physical conditioning is the platform that every other skill sits on. Technical ability counts for nothing if you're struggling to cover ground or hold your level in the second half.",
    drill: "Three times a week, 20 minutes: 4 x 30m sprints with 30 seconds rest between each, then 3 rounds of 10 press-ups and 20 bodyweight squats. Stick to this consistently for 4 weeks and you'll feel a real difference in your acceleration and how you perform late in games.",
