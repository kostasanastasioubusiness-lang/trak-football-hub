/**
 * What the coach's form actually sends, driven through the rendered screen and
 * the real Supabase SDK.
 *
 * The defect this exists to catch: `goalsKey()` collapsed every count of two or
 * more to `'2+'`, for every position. The attacker branch of `computeMatchScore`
 * reads `'1'`, `'2'` and `'3+'` — it has no `'2+'` case — so an attacker's brace
 * fell through to no credit at all and rated identically to not scoring. The
 * unit tests were green throughout, because the mapping and the engine were each
 * correct in isolation and nothing asserted the pair.
 *
 * So this test deliberately goes the whole way: render, tap, save, and read what
 * left the client. A test that called `goalsKey` directly would have agreed with
 * the bug.
 *
 * It lives under src/ rather than beside the MSW harness it borrows, because
 * `npm test` is `vitest run src` — a file in tests/ outside tests/msw and
 * tests/support is collected by no CI step at all, and a test that never runs
 * is worse than no test. Hence the reach back up for the harness.
 *
 * One mount at a time. Four blocks mounting one page into a single jsdom in #44
 * left exactly one mounted and which one varied between runs, so each pass here
 * cleans up before the next renders.
