/**
 * TRAK-72: coach Home, Profile and player page cleanup from the 25 Sep
 * use-case test (Imad + Tarek, as coach.u15). Rendered through the real app
 * and router, with MSW standing in for Supabase.
 *
 *   1  no coach invite code on Home or Profile, and nothing writes one
 *   2  the squad tile says "Players"
 *   3  the Sessions tile opens session history
 *   5  no assessment count under a player's name
 *   9  the coach's age group sits next to their role
 *  10  "How Trak works", not "Coach manual"
