# Trak Academy Pilot — operational reference

The full runbook lives in `docs/pilot-runbook.html` (published as an artifact) and the pilot scope in
`MVP Requirements`. This file carries only the parts you run, so the narrative lives in one
place and cannot drift.

---

## Deploy order

**Migrations first.** `CoachQuickMatchLog` and `CoachAddSession` pass `p_match_date` to
`log_match_for_player`; against the old 15-argument function that call fails and coach match
logging breaks entirely.

```
20260423999999_user_role_club_value.sql        ← dated early on purpose
20260901000001_pilot_telemetry.sql
20260901000002_pilot_measurement_columns.sql
20260901000003_pilot_scorecard_views.sql
20260901000005_pilot_org_scoping.sql
20260901000006_link_player_adopts_roster_row.sql
```

Then set the pilot window and deploy the app:

```sql
UPDATE pilot_config SET starts_on = 'YYYY-MM-DD', weeks = 8, org_id = (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE name = '<the academy>');
```

**`org_id` is not optional.** Left NULL the cohort views count every squad row and parent
invite in the database — demo academies, dev accounts, old seed data — and activation
becomes meaningless. Verified in rehearsal: 3.2% unscoped, 60% scoped.

## The weekly query

Operational reports are restricted to the authorized operator SQL workflow or a
separate trusted server-side `service_role` connection. This includes every
`pilot_*` report, `squad_duplicate_candidates` and `stale_pending_consent`.
An application's `club` account still uses the `authenticated` database role;
it is not `service_role`. Denial with app credentials is expected, not evidence
that measurement is broken. Never put service credentials in browser `VITE_*`
configuration or substitute them into the legacy seed/check clients.

In the reviewed project's operator SQL editor, verify report access explicitly:

```sql
BEGIN READ ONLY;
SET LOCAL ROLE service_role;
SELECT current_user;
SELECT * FROM public.pilot_scorecard;
ROLLBACK;
```

One row per pilot week: activation, match coverage, assessment rate (H1), median seconds to
assess, rating agreement (H4, derived and blind), player and parent return, safeguarding flags.

For S3, record the target project, deployed migration, querying role, configured
academy/window and observed values. Permission alone does not prove that numbers
are correct. The legacy checker skips these reports; it cannot attest to their
contents or migration state using an application key.

### J7 — the one-minute answer (TRAK-10)

"How many assessments did each coach make this week, and how many player and
parent opens were there?" Same operator workflow as above:

```sql
BEGIN READ ONLY;
SET LOCAL ROLE service_role;
SELECT * FROM public.pilot_j7_this_week;
ROLLBACK;
```

One row per pilot coach (`metric = 'assessments'`, 0 if they assessed nobody),
plus `player_opens` and `parent_opens`. `week` is the current pilot week.

What counts, and what does not:

| Number | Counts | Never counts |
|---|---|---|
| Assessments | Distinct assessments a coach saved from the assessment screen this week (`assessment_submitted`), where the row exists and is theirs. An edit counts as that week's work; `created` in the drill-down tells new from edited. | Seeded rows (no UI event), the same assessment saved twice, an event naming someone else's or a missing row |
| Player opens | Distinct (child, assessment) pairs where the child's home showed the coach's **published** message (`feedback_opened`) | Repeat views, unpublished messages, another child's message |
| Parent opens | Distinct (parent, assessment) pairs where parent home showed the child's latest assessment, i.e. the bands (`assessment_viewed`). Parents never see the message (TRAK-63). | Repeat views, a parent not linked to that child |

Everyone counted is in the pilot academy (`pilot_config.org_id`) and not a
synthetic account (`@trak.dev`, `@*.trak.dev`, `example.*`, `*.test`,
`*.invalid`, `*.example`, `*.localhost`).

Another week, or the detail behind a number:

```sql
SELECT week, coach_user_id, count(*) AS assessments FROM pilot_j7_assessments GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 1, 2;
SELECT week, role, count(*) AS opens, count(DISTINCT user_id) AS people FROM pilot_j7_opens GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

**Rehearsal only:** `UPDATE pilot_config SET count_synthetic = true;` makes the
Rehearsal FC accounts count, so TRAK-24 can see the numbers move. Set it back
to `false` before the pilot. With it `false`, the report on today's database
correctly shows nothing, because every account on it is synthetic.

Assessment events from before 26 Sep carry no `assessment_id` and are not
counted; they were all synthetic.

### Drill-downs

Run these reports and the H4 query below through the same authorized workflow.

| Metric | View |
|---|---|
| 1 Activation | `pilot_activation` |
| 2 Match coverage | `pilot_match_coverage` |
| 3 Assessment rate — **H1** | `pilot_assessment_rate` |
| 4 Time to assess | `pilot_time_to_assess` |
| 5 Rating agreement — **H4** | `pilot_rating_agreement_derived`, `pilot_rating_agreement` |
| 6–7 Return by role | `pilot_retention` |
| 8 Safeguarding | `pilot_safeguarding_checks` — **must return zero rows** |

### H4 position-bias check — run weekly from week 1

```sql
SELECT position,
       count(*)                   AS n,
       round(avg(engine_bias), 2) AS avg_bias,
       round(100.0 * count(*) FILTER (WHERE agrees) / count(*), 1) AS agreement_pct
FROM pilot_rating_agreement_derived
GROUP BY position
ORDER BY avg_bias;
```

Negative `avg_bias` means the engine bands **lower** than the coach. A consistent negative for
`gk`/`def` beside a positive for `att` is the systematic bias the scope predicts.

## Staff accounts — Trak sets them up

Nobody signs up as a coach or academy admin, and a coach cannot choose or change
their academy (TRAK-12, `20260926100000_staff_set_up_by_trak.sql`). The app
refuses all of it. The operator creates staff, one person at a time:

1. **Create the login.** Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Users: create the
   user directly (not an email invitation) with their email, a long random password
   that you neither keep nor send, and the email auto-confirmed. The app's handling
   of Supabase invitation links has no tests; the password reset in step 4 does.
2. **Admit them** in the dashboard SQL editor, which runs as `postgres`. Don't switch
   to an app role: the call refuses `authenticated` and `anon`. Do the admin first,
   because it creates the academy, then each coach into it:

   ```sql
   -- Academy admin: returns the academy id, creating the academy if they have none.
   SELECT public.admit_staff_member(
     (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = lower('<admin email>')),
     'club', '<Full Name>', NULL, '<Academy name>');
   -- Coach: into an existing academy.
   SELECT public.admit_staff_member(
     (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = lower('<coach email>')),
     'coach', '<Full Name>', (SELECT id FROM public.organizations WHERE name = '<Academy name>'));
   ```

   It refuses a missing account, an empty name, a coach with no existing academy,
   and an account that already has a different role.
3. **Check** before telling them:

   ```sql
   SELECT p.role, p.full_name, p.invite_code, o.name AS academy
   FROM public.profiles p
   LEFT JOIN public.coach_details cd ON cd.user_id = p.user_id
   LEFT JOIN public.organizations o
     ON o.id = cd.organization_id OR o.admin_user_id = p.user_id
   WHERE p.user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = lower('<email>'));
   ```

4. **Tell them** to open trakfootball.com, tap *Forgot password?* with that email,
   and set their own password from the email. Their profile is already there when
   they first sign in. A coach's `invite_code` is what their players type to link.

**Moving a coach** to another academy: run the coach call again with the new
academy. **Removing** one: run
`UPDATE public.coach_details SET organization_id = NULL WHERE user_id = …` in the
same editor. The academy screens are "Coming soon" for the pilot (TRAK-43), so an
admin can't do it in the app. Never hand out service credentials to do any of this
from a client.

## Rehearsal data

```bash
TRAK_REHEARSAL_PASSWORD='<set a fresh one, do not commit it>' node seed-pilot-rehearsal.mjs
```

Two squads, ~30 players, six weeks of fixtures, matches, assessments and awards under
`@rehearsal.trak.test` / "Rehearsal FC". Reset with `--purge`.

The seed signs its staff in with the app key, so it can only use staff who already
exist. Re-running it over the rehearsal academy works, including after `--purge`: the
academy and its coaches survive a purge. A rebuild in an empty project needs the staff
admitted first, with the steps above: `director@` as `club` with academy name
"Rehearsal FC", then `coach.u15@`, `coach.u17@` and `coach.gk@` into it. Then run
the seed.

`telemetry_events` stays **empty** after seeding — it is written by the app, not the script. That
is deliberate: metrics 4, 6 and 7 stay blank until you click through the smoke test below.

## Smoke test — the gate on week 0

`trackEvent` fails silently for the user, so a missing table looks exactly like a working one.
Ten event types must appear before the pilot starts; a missing event cannot be backfilled.

| Do this | Event |
|---|---|
| Open the app | `app_opened` |
| One full assessment | `assessment_submitted` (non-null `duration_ms` and `assessment_id`) |
| Quick-assess 3 players | `quick_assess_completed` (`players: 3`) |
| Build a roster | `roster_built` |
| Log a match | `match_logged` (`actor: 'coach'`) |
| Paste fixtures | `schedule_parsed` |
| Ask the assistant | `assistant_used` |
| As player, open feedback | `feedback_opened` |
| As parent, open alerts | `alert_opened` |
| As parent, open home with an assessed child | `assessment_viewed` (`assessment_id`) |

```sql
SELECT event_type, role, count(*), max(created_at)
FROM telemetry_events
GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 1;
```

In development the console logs `[telemetry] "<event>" failed:` on any write error.

## A guardian resets a child's password

A guardian can set a new password for a child who signs in with a username:
Profile → the child's login card (e.g. "Sam's login") → *Set a new password*
(TRAK-84). The reset also signs the child out of every device (TRAK-104): an
open app signs out within 30 seconds, or as soon as its tab is opened again,
and the card says the child "is now signed out on every device".

- **"…couldn't sign … out of other devices":** the new password is set, but
  the sign-out didn't happen. Set the password again; that retries it.
- **A copied access token** keeps working until it expires, at most one hour
  on this project. For a lost or shared phone, still tell the founders the
  same day.

## Duplicate roster rows

Player signup now adopts the coach's own roster entry instead of inserting a second one.
Any duplicates created before that fix are surfaced, not merged:

Use the same authorized operator/service-role workflow as the weekly query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM squad_duplicate_candidates;
```

Merging is a human decision — assessments and awards may hang off either row.

## Invitations that didn't go

When the loader reports `Invitations went for N child(ren); not for line(s) …`, or a
run stopped part-way, those families were admitted but some guardians never got an
email. A plain re-run won't fix it: it skips children who are already admitted.
`--reinvite` (TRAK-91) is the recovery. Run it with the **same file**:

```bash
# 1. Dry run: reads the roster, admits nothing, says which lines it would re-send
SUPABASE_URL=… SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=sb_secret_… TRAK_CONFIRM_HOST=<project host> \
  node scripts/load-roster.mjs --file <roster.csv> --org <academy id> --loaded-by "<your name>" --reinvite
# 2. The same command with --apply sends them
```

- It picks a child only if one of their guardians was **never invited** and hasn't
  signed up. It asks the function for `only_uninvited`, so in a family where one
  guardian was invited and another wasn't, only the second gets an email. A guardian
  who already has an invitation is **never** sent a second one this way.
- A failure is reported by line (no addresses). Fix the cause, then run `--reinvite`
  again. It only ever picks up what is still missing.
- It loads nothing and refuses `--send-invites` / `--no-invites`.
- **Siblings (TRAK-97):** a guardian of several children gets **one** email. The function
  holds back the second one while their invitation for another child is under an hour
  old (Supabase's default link lifetime), marks that row invited anyway, and the loader
  prints "A guardian already had a fresh invitation for another child…". That's expected:
  their consent screen lists every child. A second `/invite` would have killed the first
  link (1 Oct: 403 `One-time token not found`).
- **An invitation that went but doesn't work** (an expired link; see TRAK-101) is not
  this case. `--reinvite` won't resend it, on purpose, and
  there is no tested resend path for it yet. Don't improvise one: raise it in the
  founders' channel with the roster child id (no address).

## Wrong address

When the academy gave a wrong child or guardian email (TRAK-16, G5), the
operator corrects it with `scripts/correct-roster-email.mjs`. The database
records who corrected it, when and why in `roster_email_corrections`, which
holds hashes of both addresses, never the addresses themselves. Needs
`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` and `TRAK_CONFIRM_HOST`, like the loader.

```bash
# 1. Dry run: reads the roster, changes nothing
node scripts/correct-roster-email.mjs --roster-child <roster child id> --kind guardian \
  --old <wrong address> --new <right address> --by "<your name>" --reason "<why>"
# 2. The same command with --apply writes it
```

- **Refused, "already claimed":** someone has already signed up with the
  wrong address. Don't work around it. It's an incident: tell the founders the
  same day, because a wrong adult may be linked to the child.
- **"An invitation had already gone to the old address":** record a G5
  near-miss on TRAK-16 (roster child id and time; no addresses). After the
  correction, that address can no longer claim the child.
- **Then re-invite** that roster child. The script sends nothing; the
  correction cleared `invited_at` so the new address gets the invitation.
- **A guardian with more than one child: correct every roster child that
  has the wrong address.** The address is stored once per child, so it sits
  on one roster row per sibling. Run the correction once for each of them,
  or the other child's invitation still goes to the wrong address. Find them
  first (read-only, in the SQL editor):

  ```sql
  SELECT roster_child_id FROM roster_guardians
  WHERE lower(btrim(email)) = lower(btrim('<wrong address>'));
  ```
- The addresses go only on the command line on the operator's own machine,
  never into Slack or Linear.

## Wrong child name

A rostered child's name is the academy's roster name, everywhere (TRAK-103):
the coach, the family and the child all see `squad_players.player_name`. The
child can't change it, and neither can a direct edit of `profiles.full_name`,
not even by the table owner in the SQL editor. That is refused with 42501
"Your academy sets your name". When the academy gave a wrong name, correct it
on the roster's squad row; the child's profile follows by itself:

```sql
-- Find the squad row first (read-only): the child's roster id, from the load output.
SELECT sp.id, sp.player_name FROM roster_children rc
JOIN squad_players sp ON sp.id = rc.squad_player_id WHERE rc.id = '<roster child id>';
-- Then correct it:
UPDATE squad_players SET player_name = '<right name>' WHERE id = '<squad player id>';
```

Only the operator does this; no coach screen edits a name. The child sees
the name at setup ("You're added as …"), so ask families to report a wrong one.
