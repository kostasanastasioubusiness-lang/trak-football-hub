# Trak Academy Pilot — operational reference

The full runbook lives in `docs/pilot-runbook.html` (published as an artifact) and the scope in
`docs/pilot-scope.html`. This file carries only the parts you run, so the narrative lives in one
place and cannot drift.

---

## Deploy order

**Migrations first.** `CoachQuickMatchLog` and `CoachAddSession` pass `p_match_date` to
`log_match_for_player`; against the old 15-argument function that call fails and coach match
logging breaks entirely.

```
20260423999999_user_role_club_value.sql        ← dated early on purpose
20260901000001_pilot_telemetry.sql
20260901000002_pilot_measurement_columns.sql
20260901000003_pilot_scorecard_views.sql
20260901000005_pilot_org_scoping.sql
20260901000006_link_player_adopts_roster_row.sql
```

Then set the pilot window and deploy the app:

```sql
UPDATE pilot_config SET starts_on = 'YYYY-MM-DD', weeks = 8, org_id = (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE name = '<the academy>');
```

**`org_id` is not optional.** Left NULL the cohort views count every squad row and parent
invite in the database — demo academies, dev accounts, old seed data — and activation
becomes meaningless. Verified in rehearsal: 3.2% unscoped, 60% scoped.

## The weekly query

```sql
SELECT * FROM pilot_scorecard;
```

One row per pilot week: activation, match coverage, assessment rate (H1), median seconds to
assess, rating agreement (H4, derived and blind), player and parent return, safeguarding flags.

### Drill-downs

| Metric | View |
|---|---|
| 1 Activation | `pilot_activation` |
| 2 Match coverage | `pilot_match_coverage` |
| 3 Assessment rate — **H1** | `pilot_assessment_rate` |
| 4 Time to assess | `pilot_time_to_assess` |
| 5 Rating agreement — **H4** | `pilot_rating_agreement_derived`, `pilot_rating_agreement` |
| 6–7 Return by role | `pilot_retention` |
| 8 Safeguarding | `pilot_safeguarding_checks` — **must return zero rows** |

### H4 position-bias check — run weekly from week 1

```sql
SELECT position,
       count(*)                   AS n,
       round(avg(engine_bias), 2) AS avg_bias,
       round(100.0 * count(*) FILTER (WHERE agrees) / count(*), 1) AS agreement_pct
FROM pilot_rating_agreement_derived
GROUP BY position
ORDER BY avg_bias;
```

Negative `avg_bias` means the engine bands **lower** than the coach. A consistent negative for
`gk`/`def` beside a positive for `att` is the systematic bias the scope predicts.

## Rehearsal data

```bash
node seed-pilot-rehearsal.mjs
```

Two squads, ~30 players, six weeks of fixtures, matches, assessments and awards under
`@rehearsal.trak.dev` / "Rehearsal FC". Reset with `--purge`.

`telemetry_events` stays **empty** after seeding — it is written by the app, not the script. That
is deliberate: metrics 4, 6 and 7 stay blank until you click through the smoke test below.

## Smoke test — the gate on week 0

`trackEvent` fails silently for the user, so a missing table looks exactly like a working one.
Nine event types must appear before the pilot starts; a missing event cannot be backfilled.

| Do this | Event |
|---|---|
| Open the app | `app_opened` |
| One full assessment | `assessment_submitted` (non-null `duration_ms`) |
| Quick-assess 3 players | `quick_assess_completed` (`players: 3`) |
| Build a roster | `roster_built` |
| Log a match | `match_logged` (`actor: 'coach'`) |
| Paste fixtures | `schedule_parsed` |
| Ask the assistant | `assistant_used` |
| As player, open feedback | `feedback_opened` |
| As parent, open alerts | `alert_opened` |

```sql
SELECT event_type, role, count(*), max(created_at)
FROM telemetry_events
GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 1;
```

In development the console logs `[telemetry] "<event>" failed:` on any write error.

## Duplicate roster rows

Player signup now adopts the coach's own roster entry instead of inserting a second one.
Any duplicates created before that fix are surfaced, not merged:

```sql
SELECT * FROM squad_duplicate_candidates;
```

Merging is a human decision — assessments and awards may hang off either row.
