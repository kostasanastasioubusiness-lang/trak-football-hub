# September 20 user testing: fixes and acceptance criteria

Source: Imad's `trak_use_cases_and_testing.md`, read September 20, 2026. This tracks every observation, including suggestions that need design work. Reports are not proof of root cause. Related open PRs are not deployed fixes. Canonical main at intake: `dc5c9d5`; this parent work starts from fork integration `92e537b`.

## Decisions and priority

**Latest September 20 decision:** the source document's **Trak Architecture for Academy, Coach, Player, and Parent Sign Up** section controls signup/invitations. This supersedes the earlier deferral of payment-triggered household activation, one shared household login and parent-created child usernames. Conflicting observations elsewhere do not override it. See [the controlling architecture and acceptance plan](../plans/academy-led-admission.md). Imad confirmed fully waived academy enrolment for the entire pilot: no payments now or later, no billing integration or automatic conversion. Academy approval replaces the payment trigger while preserving household activation and consent. Removing a signup screen alone does not enforce admission at the backend.

Under-18 approval in Greece and UAE is a Trak pilot policy pending legal review. No waiver, invitation or payment flow by itself establishes legal compliance. Existing independent-guardian consent behavior must be reconciled with the new household identity before release; do not silently rewrite historical guardian evidence. Private coach notes stay private unless explicitly shared.

1. Admission, consent, academy/coach isolation and account correctness block real-child use.
2. Repair lost/incorrect records, failed saves, unusable views and misleading loading/errors.
3. Complete parent details, confirmed schedules and truthful totals.
4. Validate exports, simplify duplicate navigation and rehearse all roles on phones.

Suggested owner below follows the current pilot plan, not an assertion that another contributor has accepted new work. Coordinate files in #coding-agent-reviews before implementation.

## Parent slice: scope, acceptance and release

Scope: make Home recent matches, Matches rows, and Alerts match/assessment/recognition entries accessible buttons opening readable details. Home's latest assessment also opens. Fetch match facts with explicit safe columns, selected child ID and match ID. Do not retrieve private notes, self-reflection or AI drafts. Unknown facts stay unknown; zero is a recorded value. Do not invent a causal explanation for a rating.

Acceptance: activate by click and keyboard; show exact selected record; Escape/Close returns focus; details fit a 390px phone and scroll vertically; failed/missing/malformed/wrong-child responses show retry; child/account removal unmounts details; delayed responses cannot reopen another identity's record; rejected refresh removes cached facts. Regression tests must fail before the fix, then pass with the implementation. Built-app browser checks use intercepted synthetic responses, never production writes.

Rollout: commit and CI on the fork, peer review, integrate after dependent parent changes, then request production approval. No schema changes in this slice. Rollback is a reviewed frontend revert of this slice; do not revert access-control or consent dependencies. A local passing test is not live verification. Account deletion/history/coach-link integration from the base remain independently reviewable work.

## Inventory

Status **reported** means not yet reproduced in this branch. **Related** means existing work may cover it, but needs a targeted retest against the final integration. **Implemented locally** does not mean released.

## Dependencies and next execution

The parent detail slice is based on tested fork integration `92e537b`, which includes open parent work and #17. It is not a small standalone diff against today's canonical main. Review the incremental change against that base; do not bypass dependency review by merging a large integration blindly.

Next parent tasks: confirmed next-session query/widget and full-history stats after the calendar/consent contracts are settled; duplicate-email and shared-phone reproduction; invite delivery and avatar failures. Consent data enforcement remains higher priority for real-child admission than these UI additions. The earlier temporary uncommitted P2 cutover checkout disappeared; rebuild from committed #70 in a persistent worktree and rerun all affected SQL/role/concurrency tests. Historical draft test results do not verify a reconstruction.

Do not mark any item done until source, tests, review, deployment and live synthetic verification are separately recorded. No promise of zero remaining bugs from a passing subset.

## Parent details verification — September 20

- Reproduction: all 14 new render + real SDK/MSW tests failed on the unchanged UI (no record action existed).
- After implementation: 39 parent-family tests pass; full source suite 509 passes. Typecheck passes. Lint: zero errors, 129 existing warnings; changed source files have no lint findings.
- Built-app Chromium 147 mobile tests: all 8 parent journeys pass, including opening match details from Home/Matches/Alerts and assessment details from Home/Alerts; keyboard activation, Escape/focus restoration, and no horizontal dialog overflow. Screenshots visually inspected after animations finish. Browser HTTP is intercepted synthetic data, not a live authenticated Supabase test.
- Existing DB regression replay: 67 migrations, parent invite/backfill, 282 operational-view assertions, 151 privilege/consent assertions, 81 parent-history assertions pass in disposable PGlite. No SQL migration added by this slice.
- Harness: 17 passes. Use-case gate: two enforced cases pass; three pre-existing UC-A02 player-log tests fail as pending/non-blocking; 14 pending cases have no tests. They are still defects/debt, not a green end-to-end platform claim.
- Initial browser attempt could not launch because Chromium 1217 was absent; installing the repository's required browser resolved this environment issue. The subsequent eight-test runs pass.
- Upstream #38 was separately approved and merged during this work at `4335e89`. Release verification is tracked independently; this parent detail slice is not deployed by #38.

## Latest handoff evidence

Parent details: [fork PR #1](https://github.com/imadd23x/trak-football-hub/pull/1), implementation `fdf51aa`, integrated head `79e468b`; [fork CI passed](https://github.com/imadd23x/trak-football-hub/actions/runs/35501643953). No production deployment. The subsequent change to this inventory is documentation only.

Password visibility: [upstream PR #71](https://github.com/kostasanastasioubusiness-lang/trak-football-hub/pull/71), fork commit `7216ae0`; [fork CI](https://github.com/imadd23x/trak-football-hub/actions/runs/35502164827) and [upstream CI](https://github.com/kostasanastasioubusiness-lang/trak-football-hub/actions/runs/35502223413) passed. This standalone PR is based on main and does not depend on the parent-history integration. No production deployment.

Calendar #38: explicitly authorized by Imad, merged at `4335e89`; [production CI](https://github.com/kostasanastasioubusiness-lang/trak-football-hub/actions/runs/35501564264) passed including Supabase and frontend. Live public DOB route and actual deployed calendar helper checked in Dubai, Athens and Los Angeles with a fixed birthday-boundary clock; zero writes or page errors. [Release evidence](https://github.com/kostasanastasioubusiness-lang/trak-football-hub/pull/38#issuecomment-5748898983). DB still has 66 migrations and legacy threshold 15; this was not the P2 cutover. #42 corrects a UTC DOB **test fixture**, not the separate production `player_age_years` session-timezone issue.

UT-05 source trace: `DevSetupPage.tsx` and `supabase/seeds/dev_data.sql` seed the same fixed roster row as Jamie Wilson. Coach views use `squad_players.player_name`; parent views resolve `profiles.full_name`. The live join establishes the mismatched names but does not establish who or what renamed the profile. Do not repair by fuzzy matching, auto-merging histories, or rerunning a seed against production.


## September 20 follow-up: main and testing priorities

Canonical main was rechecked from GitHub's commit history and production workflow: still `4335e89`, the approved #38 merge at 09:10 UTC (13:10 Dubai). Kostas's `c5c94f2` merges main **into** the still-open #44; it does not put #44 on main. Latest main workflow `35501564264` succeeded. This observation is a dated snapshot, not a claim about future pushes.

The original markdown remains the acceptance inventory. Consent work has not completed the list. UT-15/16/17 parent record details ([fork #1](https://github.com/imadd23x/trak-football-hub/pull/1)), UT-20 password visibility ([upstream #71](https://github.com/kostasanastasioubusiness-lang/trak-football-hub/pull/71)) and UT-33 private avatars ([fork #2](https://github.com/imadd23x/trak-football-hub/pull/2)) are implemented/tested in review, not deployed. UT-03's [draft fork #3](https://github.com/imadd23x/trak-football-hub/pull/3) is explicitly not a release candidate.

UT-19 is the current standalone implementation from main. Signup returns can be obfuscated for an existing confirmed account; a returned user without a session proves neither new account creation nor delivered email. The old child screen claimed both account creation and a sent guardian invitation before authenticated provisioning had run. The replacement provides conditional confirmation guidance, direct sign-in and password recovery, honest resend status and retry. Explicit duplicate errors keep the form and a sign-in action. It adds no lookup endpoint or permission change.

Verification: nine routed-form tests use the real AuthProvider and Supabase SDK with synthetic intercepted HTTP; they fail on the old implementation and pass after the fix. Three built 390px browser journeys cover player/coach/administrator duplicate responses, resend failure/retry and recovery, with no session stored, no profile or parent-invite calls, no unexpected external requests, no page errors and no horizontal overflow. The player screen was visually inspected. Full source 394, harness 17 and all eight browser journeys pass; typecheck/build pass; lint zero errors/133 existing warnings. Three pending UC-A02 failures and 15 pending untested use cases remain. Tests do not verify live email latency, confirmation consumption or mail delivery.

Next priorities remain UT-21/22 shared-phone and confirmation behavior, UT-14 confirmed next session, UT-10 complete truthful totals, plus UT-35 connection-state consistency. Coordinate coach session history/validation/loading issues UT-11/12/23/27–32 with Kostas and player export/series issues UT-36–38 with Tarek, using their actual PR heads and targeted retests; do not mark them fixed because related code exists. Complete the consent/AI/history integration before real-child admission. The later architecture clarification supersedes the earlier UT-41 deferral; follow the controlling academy-led admission plan.


## Architecture clarification supersedes earlier signup assumptions

Imad has now explicitly selected the architecture section over conflicting signup/invitation observations. The earlier free-pilot invitation-only deferral is historical, not the current instruction. PR #73 is held as a draft/transitional fix; its passing tests do not establish the target admission model. Password visibility, truthful errors, private avatars and record details remain applicable where they fit the new flow. The rest of the testing list remains active; only contradictory signup/admission requirements are superseded.

Pilot enrolment decision resolved: fully waived academy-approved enrolment; no payments now or later for the pilot. The pilot exists to collect data/feedback. Do not introduce billing or treat a waived enrolment as a deferred charge.
