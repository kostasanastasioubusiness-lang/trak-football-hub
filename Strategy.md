Trak Football — Developer Strategy & MVP Brief

This document is the single source of truth.
Do not make assumptions. If something is unclear, ask before building.
A working prototype (v4) exists and is the visual reference for every screen — request access if you do not have it.


1. What is Trak?
Trak is a player-first career tracking platform for academy and semi-professional footballers aged 13–18. The founding principle is simple: the player owns their career.
Three user types form the core triangle:
RolePrimary PurposePlayerLogs matches, receives a performance band, tracks goals, earns medalsCoachAssesses players across 6 categories, logs sessions, manages squadParentFollows their child's development — read-only access via invite
What makes Trak different from everything else out there:
LeagueApps, SportsEngine and similar platforms are organisational admin tools — registration, payments, scheduling. They are sold to club administrators. Trak lives on the player's phone and is about their personal development journey. There is no meaningful overlap.

2. Tech Stack
LayerTechnologyFrontendReact + Tailwind CSS (Lovable)DatabaseSupabase — PostgreSQL, Frankfurt regionAuthSupabase Auth with email confirmationEmailResend SMTP via trakfootball.comRepoPrivate GitHub — you already have access

3. Current State of the Codebase
Phase 1 (auth, onboarding, role-based routing) is partially built in Lovable. Treat the existing codebase as a starting point only. The design system has changed significantly — do not preserve the old visual style. The v4 prototype is the reference for everything going forward.

4. Design System — Follow This Exactly
The entire app uses a single consistent design language. Do not deviate from these values.
Colours
css--bg:        #0A0A0B   /* near-black — base background */
--s1:        #101012   /* surface — cards */
--s2:        #17171A   /* elevated surface */
--s3:        #202024   /* input backgrounds */
--border:    rgba(255,255,255,0.07)
--border-md: rgba(255,255,255,0.11)
--accent:    #C8F25A   /* volt green — primary accent */
--t1:        rgba(255,255,255,0.88)  /* primary text */
--t2:        rgba(255,255,255,0.45)  /* secondary text */
--t3:        rgba(255,255,255,0.22)  /* muted text */
Typography
Display / headings:  DM Sans, weight 300–400
Labels / metadata:   DM Mono, weight 500
Body:                DM Sans, weight 400
Key rules:

Large display numbers and band words: DM Sans weight 300, 40–56px, letter-spacing -0.03em
All section labels, metadata, timestamps: DM Mono weight 500, 9px, letter-spacing 0.12em, uppercase
Never use weight 700 except on buttons

Spacing & Radius
Border radius — small:  10px
Border radius — medium: 14px
Border radius — large:  18px
Border radius — xl:     24px
Card padding: 16px
Screen horizontal padding: 20px
Nav Bar
Glassmorphism. background: rgba(10,10,11,0.92), backdrop-filter: blur(24px).
Active state: background: rgba(200,242,90,0.06), label colour #C8F25A.

5. Performance Bands — Critical
There are NO decimal ratings visible anywhere in the app. The algorithm runs in the background and maps to one of 7 bands. This is the core UX decision and must not be changed.
BandColourHexWhenExceptionalVolt#C8F25A9.2+StandoutSoft lime#86efac8.2–9.1GoodGreen#4ade807.2–8.1SteadyBlue#60a5fa6.4–7.1MixedMuted orange#fb923c5.6–6.3DevelopingSoft purple#a78bfa4.8–5.5DifficultNear-white mutedrgba(255,255,255,0.4)Below 4.8
Rules:

Player sees the band word only — never the underlying number
Coach sees the band word only — never the underlying number
The computed number lives in the database for trend analysis only
The language is always positive — "Developing" not "Poor", "Difficult" not "Terrible"
Never use red anywhere in the app

Band display CSS
css.band-exceptional { background: rgba(200,242,90,0.15); color: #C8F25A; border: 1px solid rgba(200,242,90,0.3); }

6. The Rating Algorithm
The computed score runs silently. The player never sees the number — only the band it maps to.
Baseline: 6.5
Range: 4.0 minimum, 10.0 maximum
Friendly matches: all modifiers × 0.8
Score modifiers
ConditionModifierTeam won+0.3Team lost–0.2Team drew0Self-rating: Excellent+0.4Self-rating: Good+0.2Self-rating: Average0Self-rating: Poor–0.3Yellow card–0.2Red card–0.6Body: Fresh+0.1Body: Knock–0.15Played full match (80 min)+0.1Played under 45 min–0.1
Position-specific modifiers (Attacker example)
InputModifierGoals scored: 1+0.3Goals scored: 2+0.5Goals scored: 3++0.7Shots on target: 3–4+0.2Shots on target: 5++0.35Attacking threat: Dangerous+0.15Attacking threat: Dominant+0.3
Goalkeeper, Defender and Midfielder each have their own modifier sets — request the full algorithm document if needed.
The live preview on the match log form updates in real time as the player fills in the form. Show the band word with its colour. Never show the number.

7. Connection System — Invite Codes
All connections use invite codes. There is no search by name.
Coach → Player connection

Each coach has a unique 6-character code: format TRK-XXXX
Coach shares this code with players verbally or via their own messaging
Player enters the code during onboarding (Step 3) or from their profile
Connection is instant — no approval required

Player → Parent connection

Player generates a 6-character parent code: format PAR-XXXX
Parent downloads Trak, selects Parent role on landing
Parent enters the code → app shows child's name and details for confirmation
Parent creates account → immediately connected
Parent has read-only access — they cannot edit anything

What the parent can see
✓ Match results and performance bands
✓ Coach assessments — all six category colours and band words
✓ Goals and progress
✗ Private match inputs (body condition, self-rating details)
✗ Any other player's data

9. Medals
6 medals total. All unlocked automatically by the system — player does not trigger them.
MedalTriggerFirst MatchPlayer logs their first matchOn a RollMatches logged in 5 consecutive weeksFirst StarFirst Exceptional or Standout bandTen Down10 matches loggedMost ImprovedBand distribution improves over any 10-match windowSelf AwarePlayer self-rating aligns with coach band within one band, 5 times

10. Goals Logic
Auto-tracked goals
These update automatically when a match is logged:

Goals scored this season
Matches played this season
Matches with a Standout or Exceptional band

When a match is saved, the app checks all active goals and updates progress. The match result screen shows a goal update card if any progress was made.
Manual goals
Everything else — "improve my first touch", "get selected for first team". Player goes to the goal and selects their progress level: Just started / Making progress / Nearly there / Achieved it. They can add a short note. Coach and parent see this update.

13. RLS Policies (Key Rules)

Players can only read/write their own data
Coaches can read data for players connected to them only
Parents can read data for their connected child only — no write access
Invite codes are publicly readable (so the app can validate them) but only the owner can generate/regenerate them
Assessment notes are visible to the assessed player and their coach only — not to parents


14. Launch Markets
Greece, Cyprus, Belgium, Netherlands.
Important: LeagueApps and SportsEngine have minimal presence in Greece and Cyprus — our primary launch markets. In Belgium and Netherlands some clubs may use LeagueApps for admin. Trak does not compete with these tools — it is the player's personal development record, not the club's admin system.

15. What to Build First (Suggested Order)

Auth + role routing — player / coach / parent, email confirmation, persistent sessions. 
Player onboarding — 4 steps, position selection, invite code entry for coach, invite parent.
Match log form — all fields, position-specific questions, live band preview, save to Supabase.
Player home — hero card with "This season" band distribution, trend bars, recent matches.
Coach onboarding + invite code generation — coach gets their TRK-XXXX code on signup.
Coach assessment form — 6 sliders, band output, save to Supabase, notify player.
Parent onboarding — enter PAR-XXXX code, see child confirmation, create account.
Parent home — hero card, latest assessment, goals.
Goals, medals, profiles — complete the remaining screens.


16. Important Notes for the Developer
Do not show decimal numbers anywhere. Not to the player, not to the coach, not to the parent. The number lives only in the database.
Do not add features not listed here. The MVP scope is intentional. Every feature not listed was explicitly cut for good reason. Phase 2 features include: training log, wellness standalone, highlights, CV export, 1-on-1 requests, attendance, coach progress dashboard.
The v4 prototype is the design reference. Every layout, every component, every colour, every font size was deliberate. If something in the prototype looks different from what you would normally build, follow the prototype.
Mobile first, max width 430px. This is a mobile app. Do not build for desktop.
The band vocabulary is fixed. The 7 words are: Exceptional, Standout, Good, Steady, Mixed, Developing, Difficult. Do not change them or add alternatives.
Ask before interpreting. If the brief does not cover something specifically, ask. Do not guess and build.
